This dataset includes comprehensive data on students' exam results in three subjects: writing, reading, and math. A single student is represented by each record, which contains information about the student's gender, race and ethnicity, type of meal (reduced or free), parental education level, and whether or not the student took a test-prep course. These variables aid in the explanation of the potential relationships between various socioeconomic and personal characteristics and academic results. Each subject's exam results are included in numerical form in the dataset, enabling comparison and trend analysis of performance.
