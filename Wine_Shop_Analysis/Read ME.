This dataset links laboratory measurements of red wine with human tasting judgments and actual wine-food pairing records. It combines physicochemical variables (acidity, residual sugar, sulphates, alcohol, pH, sulfur compounds, density, etc.) 
with expert quality scores and curated pairing data (wine category, food item/cuisine, numeric pairing score, text label, and short description).


Practical Details
Schema Compatibility: Clean, tidy tables make it easy to move from EDA to modeling or dashboarding.
Reproducibility: Structured features and clear targets support robust, repeatable workflows.
Broad Audience: Useful for learning, portfolio-building, competitions, and production-level prototypes.
